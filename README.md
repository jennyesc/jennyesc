Hello, I am Jenny Escobell

I am a Web Developer and interested in expanding my knowledge of all things web dev related. 
Prior to this career pivot, I was a Graphic Designer and Marketing Coordinator.

I am currently working on JavaScript, React, and WordPress projects and actively looking to break into the industry.

I can be reached at hello@jennyescobell.com
